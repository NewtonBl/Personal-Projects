# Text Analysis

Text Analysis of raw text from a .txt file.

This R project imports text from a local file named "text.txt". 
It then extracts all words from the text, eliminates numbers, converts to lowercase, and eliminates commonly used words that don't provide insight (e.g. "a", "the", "at" etc...)
It counts the number of occurrences of each word and creates a .csv file of the top 50 words, as well as a visualization of the top 25 words.

This was a personal project to help provide some insight into the key words that attracted me to certain jobs, consciously or otherwise.
